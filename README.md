Our project aims to create an advanced CVT simulation tool that integrates complex mathematical models, a rendering engine, and a user-friendly interface to accurately model the transmission's dynamics. The objective is to streamline the tuning process, allowing for faster adjustments to the transmission and reducing the need for labor-intensive physical testing. By simulating real-world behavior, the tool will help engineers experiment with different tuning parameters to achieve optimal performance, improving vehicle acceleration and torque output.
