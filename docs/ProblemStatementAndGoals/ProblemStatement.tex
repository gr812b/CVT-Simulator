\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
The McMaster Baja engineering team is seeking to improve the tuning process for their Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT). The tuning of a CVT typically involves extensive real-world testing of physical components, which is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies due to factors such as wear and weather. These conditions complicate the ability to fine-tune the CVTâ€™s torque transfer, which directly impacts vehicle acceleration and hill-climbing performance, both which are two of the team's main objectives in competition.


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for this capstone project is General

\noindent The extras for this capstone project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design Thinking (need to decide)
    \item Code walkthroughs (need to decide)
    \item Validation Report (need to decide)
\end{itemize}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
