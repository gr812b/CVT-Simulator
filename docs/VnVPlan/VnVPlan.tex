\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

This section serves as an overall summary of the verification and validation plan.
It includes a summary of the project and the overall objectives of the VnV plan.
The relevant documentation and other specifications are also listed.
In summary, this section provides a high level overview of the VnV plan.

\subsection{Summary}

The software that will be tested is the \progname{}, this is a system that simulates the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) system of a Baja vehicle.
The system has three components, a user interface which will allow the user to input the parameters of the CVT system and visualize the output of the simulation.
A mathematical component that will take the input parameters and simulate the CVT system.
There is also a 3D model component that will display the some models of the CVT system. 
Each of these components covered will be verified and validated to ensure that the system is functioning as intended.

\subsection{Objectives}

\noindent The objectives of testing our CVT system are to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our outputs. 
This includes evaluating that our mathematical model provides correct outputs based on provided input parameters specifically looking at the calculations of RPM, velocity, acceleration, distance, torque of the engine, clamping forces, CVT ratio, Torque and Belt slippage. 
We aim to emphasize the description over specification to make the CVT's system's behavior understandable by demonstrating how input changes influence the outputs.
We will verify that our 3D model and user interface allow users to easily input parameters to the system and interpret meaningful results. 
Our validation tests will focus on graphical models based on current available data to describe how the outputs should behave. 
We will aim to quantify these results by analyzing the difference between expected versus actual output. 
By referencing our outputs to real world data we can validate the accuracy of our mathematical model.
We will conduct useability testing to ensure that the interface is intuitive and allows users to easily input parameters, visualize results and understand the performance of the CVT.
\\
\noindent For our project attempting to optimize our systems outputs will be considered out of scope. 
Additionally, we will not verify any third party libraries used in our software as we assume that this has been previously validated. 

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\noindent \textbf{Software Requirements Specification} \citet{SRS}
\newline
This document is relevant because it it list all the requirements that the system should have and specifies how they should be achieved.
Requirements serve an important role in the verification process as the metric for determining if the system is functioning as intended.
When we do the verification of the system we will compare the system's capabilities and outputs to the requirements from the SRS document.
This will tell us what parts of the system are working as intended and which need to be changed or updated.
For validation, the specification serves and equivalent role as the metric for determining if the system is implemented correctly.
The specifications will be compared with the implementations of the system to see if they correspond.
If they do not, then the system will need to be updated so the the implementations match with the specifications.
Overall, the SRS document is important for verification and validation as it provides the metrics for determining their success.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

For the implementation verification plan, we will be using many techniques to ensure that the system is functioning as intended.
We will use the unit tests listed in the this document as well as other common testing techniques.
It will be required that all unit tests are run and pass for any PRs to be merged into their parent branch.
We will be doing code inspections during development by ensuring that all code is reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
Static analyzers will also be used throughout development to ensure a high quality codebase and will be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.
Before major milestones, full code walkthroughs will be conducted which is enforced by all team members needing to approve merges into main.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

  \noindent We will be using a wide variety of tools for automated testing and verification.
  We will use separate tools for our Unity C\# frontend and python backend.
  \bigskip
  \newline
  For the python backend we will be using the following tools:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{flake8}] - A Python linter that checks for PEP8 compliance.
    \item [\textbf{black}] - A Python code formatter that will ensure consistent code style.
    \item [\textbf{unittest}] - Python's built-in testing framework that will be used for unit testing.
    \item [\textbf{coverage}] - A testing framework for Python that will be used for code coverage.
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip
  \noindent For the Unity C\# frontend we will be using the following tools:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{SonarLint}] - C\# linter that checks for code quality and security vulnerabilities.
    \item [\textbf{StyleCop}] - C\# linter that checks for code style and formatting.
    \item [\textbf{UTF}] - A testing framework for C\# that will be used for unit testing.
    \item [\textbf{UTR}] - A testing framework for Unity that will be used for unit testing and code coverage.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent Additionally, we will be using GitHub Actions to automate our testing process.
  This will be done to ensure CI/CD and that our tests are run automatically on every push to the repository.
\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\noindent We plan on using data collected from the McMaster Baja team to validate the accuracy of our simulation.
Some of the values we are able to collect include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Primary RPM
  \item Secondary RPM
  \item CVT Ratio (from Primary and Secondary RPM)
  \item Wheel Speed
  \item GPS Speed
  \item GPS Position
  \item Acceleration
\end{itemize}

\noindent To validate this data against our simulation we plan on creating a script to compare them.
This script will compute the MSE between the two datasets and also plot that error over time.
Plotting the error will allow us to see in what scenarios the simulation is least accurate.
This will allow us to better diagnose the issues and allocate our resources to fix them.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CVT Dynamics}

This section provides tests to verify the CVT dynamics of the system.
They are based on the following functional requirements from the SRS document.
Listed is each requirement and how the tests verify each one.
\begin{itemize}
  \item [R1:] Verifies the mathematical modeling of the CVT system
  \item [R5:] Verifies the calculations of the primary clamping force
  \item [R6:] Verifies the calculations of the secondary clamping force
  \item [R9:] Verifies the calculations of RPM and engine torque
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Clamping forces}

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item{Clamping forces test-1\\}
  
  Control: Manual
            
  Initial State: The state values from Section~\ref{sec:standard_state}.
  
  Input: The input values from Section~\ref{sec:standard_inputs}.
            
  Output: The resulting graphs should show a clamping force against engine angular velocity beginning from $f_\text{clamp\_min}$, which should then rise to a peak before falling during the shifting phase. Suboptimal parameters may lead to a clamping force that is too low or too high, but a similar shape nonetheless. A typical output graph will look similar to the one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:clamping_force_graph}.
  
  Test Case Derivation: This behaviour is resulting from ideal tuning parameters, and may vary depending on inputs. Ramp and helix geometry will both have a major impact on the shape of these graphs, while weight and spring constants will affect the magnitude.
  
  How test will be performed: The script will run with the provided inputs. After execution is complete, the output will be visualized as a graph. Visual inspection will follow against Figure~\ref{fig:clamping_force_graph} for confirmation of expected behaviour.
  
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Shift}

This section provides tests to verify the shifting behaviour of the CVT system.
They are based on the following functional requirements from the SRS document.
Listed is each requirement and how the tests verify each one.

\begin{itemize}
  \item [R7:] Verifies the calculations of the sheave acceleration
  \item [R8:] Verifies the calculations of the belt acceleration
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item{Shift test-1\\}
  
  Control: Manual
            
  Initial State: The state values from Section~\ref{sec:standard_state}.
  
  Input: The input values from Section~\ref{sec:standard_inputs}.
            
  Output: The resulting graphs should show the shift distance against the engine's angular velocity. An ideal graph will look very similar to the leading edge of a square wave. A typical output graph will look similar to the one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:shift_distance_graph}.
  
  Test Case Derivation: This behaviour is resulting from the CVT's clamping forces overcoming the resistive forces just enough such that the CVT begins shifting. Once this has begun, ramp geometry is expected to cause shifting rather than the engine increasing in speed, maintaining a constant power output. With suboptimal tuning parameters passed in, one might observe a slanted shifting portion.

\subsubsection*{B / C - Clutching}

Belt engagement starts with a lot of slip when the vehicle is stationary, increasing to 100\% engagement when the vehicle is accelerating along the low ratio line. In between these two points there is slippage between the belt and the sheave. After the flyweight force overcomes the spring tension, the RPM has to increase and give more sheave pressure on the belt until there is no slippage and full engagement. This takes place as the vehicle is starting to move and as the engine speed and vehicle speed intersect at the low ratio line. This area is often critical for good and smooth take-off. Incorrect matching of springs and weights may lead to excessive slippage and belt wear.

\textbf{The clutching phase begins when the flyweight force overcomes the pretension, and lasts until the flyweights have generated enough side force to transfer the engine torque without slipping the belt.}

\subsubsection*{D - Low Ratio Acceleration}

After the sheaves have gripped the belt and they are transferring the torque without slipping, the machine will accelerate along the low ratio line. The engine speed will continue to increase as if you were in low gear in your car. While the vehicle speed is increasing the belt remains in low ratio at the bottom of the driving sheaves. The belt will not start moving out on the sheave until the flyweight force has become large enough to overcome both the pressure spring and the side pressure of the belt on the driven sheave. When the engine speed has built up to create enough centrifugal force to overcome the pressure spring and the driven sheave pressures, the belt will start shifting out and the ratio will change. This is called the “shift point” and should coincide with the power peak of the engine.

\textbf{Between full engagement and the shift point, centrifugal forces are larger than the pressure spring but less than the belt pressure from the driven clutch.}

\subsubsection*{E - Shift-Out-Point}
As the RPM of the driving clutch increases in low ratio, the centrifugal force from the flyweights will eventually be large enough to overcome the tension on the belt from the driven clutch. When this occurs, the transmission has reached the shift out point and the belt will start to move outward on the driving clutch and inward on the driven clutch. As the belt starts to move, the drive ratio is changed.

Ideally, the shift out point should be at the power peak of the engine and the shift curve should be straight from there through high ratio. In practice it may sometimes end up a little different. If you have a heavy machine and a small high revving engine, you may want the shift out point to be several hundred RPMs higher than the power peak. As the machine increases acceleration the engine may be pulled down in RPM by the increasing load as the transmission shifts out. By over-revving slightly in the beginning the engine will be pulled down on to the power peak, and smooth acceleration continues. If the shift out point was right on the power peak, the reduction in RPM would have pulled the transmission down off the peak and a more sluggish acceleration would have occurred as the transmission worked its RPM up again.

This shift out over-rev is of short duration, and highly individual depending on the combination of machine weight and engine power. On a super light drag machine with a big engine, you may get away with starting the shift-out slightly before the power peak as the power will pull you right through without an RPM drop. The best way to achieve the initial over-rev is to modify the shift curve of the flyweight right off the engagement point. This is usually done by extending the engagement flat into the shift curvature. The length and shape of the transition from engagement to shift curve will determine the amount and duration of the shift out over-rev.

\textbf{The shift out point occurs when the flyweight force overcomes the belt pressure from the driven clutch.}

\subsubsection*{F - Straight Shift}

The ideal shift-curve is “straight” between the low and high ratio. This means that the engine speed is held constant at the power peak while the transmission is shifting out and the vehicle speed is increasing. With the exception of a slight shift-out over-rev as discussed in the previous section, a straight shift at the power peak will give the maximum performance. To maintain a straight shift is not an easy task. As we saw under the discussion of the belt pressure requirements, the pressure on the belt is actually decreasing as the transmission shifts out. This decrease in belt tension may be as much as 50% between low and high ratio. If the decrease is not matched by the flyweight force, the driving clutch will compensate by lowering the engine speed. The driving clutch will always match the required belt tension by changing the engine speed if the flyweight system is not correctly calibrated. Our task is to make sure the flyweight system matches the belt forces at the peak power engine speed. Straight shifting is accomplished by calibrating the relationship of the flyweight curvature and roller location as well as the arc traveled by the flyweight. Engine speed is determined by the weight of the flyweight system.

Since the flyweight system works against the pressure spring in the driving clutch, the loads and rates of this spring also influence straight shift and engine RPM. Flyweight curvatures have been experimented with and fine tuned by the manufacturers over the last 15 years and they provide a good selection of tuning components. Polaris is a good example; they provide two basic flyweight curvatures, trail and racing. The trail curvature has lower engagement and softer shift-out than the racing curvature. Each flyweight group is available with weights in 2-4 gram increments for each curvature. Each manufacturer also has a large selection of springs with different pretensions and rates for calibration purposes. Achieving the correct combination of flyweight and spring to obtain a straight shift at the correct engine speed is the task of the tuner. This will be covered in greater detail under the Selection of Components and Testing chapters.

\textbf{Straight shift is obtained by matching curvature and spring rates; correct engine speed is dependent on the weight of the flyweight.}

\subsubsection*{G - Over-Run}

When the transmission is shifted all the way out into high ratio, engine speed must increase along the high ratio line as vehicle speed increases.

As the engine speed increases, the power curve goes off the peak on the back side and less power is available to propel the machine. Maximum speed cannot be obtained if you are off the peak; this means the machine is geared too low. There may be conditions where this is done on purpose because acceleration is more important than top speed. In most cases the machines are geared to give maximum top speed, which means they will seldom reach high ratio and over-run is not usually experienced.

\textbf{In over-run, the clutches are shifted all the way out and the flyweight forces have no more influence on the engine speed. Engine speed will increase along the fixed high ratio line.} \citet{Aaen2007}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\ 
  When writing this deliverable there was a lot of things that went well.
  Firstly the team had a long sitdown with our capstone supervisor Dr Smith to discuss the process of how we will be validating our simulation.
  We were able to come up with a great plan for how the simulation will be validated against real world data and how to incorperate that into this document and the project as a whole.
  The team was also able to have some great communication with each other when figuring out how to write the various kinds of tests for the system.
  Since there was a lot of different types of tests we were constantly bouncing ideas off each other to figure out the best way to move forward.
  Team communication such as that is always a good thing and this deliverable specifically had a lot of that in it.
  Another thing that went well was the team was able to figure out who on the McMaster Baja team will help us validate our simulation once the implementation is complete.
  We outlined a list of people that will help us in section 3 of this document and we were able to get in contact with them and they are all on board to help us validate the simulation.  

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\
    When writing this deliverable there was only one pain point that needed to be resolved.
    The first one was how to write the functional tests for the math component of the system.
    Due to the nature of our project the simulation outputs are not something that will be able to be verified/validated numerically or with a simple test.
    Instead we will need to compare the outputs of the simulation to the outputs of the physical car.
    Therefore we had to change the way that we wrote the functional requirements, and instead of writing them as a simple test we wrote them as a comparison between some specific part of the simulation output and against the same data gathered from the physical car.
    The way this pain point was resolved was through sitting down with our capstone supervisor Dr Smith and talked the process of how we will be validating our simulation and he was the one who gave us the reccomendation to write the functional requirements in this way.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

  In order to successfully complete the verification and validation of our project the team will need to acquire various knowledge and skills regarding testing.
  Some areas that we will need to gather skills in will be in areas of testing such as dynamic testing, static testing, unit testing and system testing. 
  As well the team will need to learn how to use specific tools for the various languages that we will be using.
  For python this will include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item coverage
    \item unittest
    \item Flake8 (linter)
    \item black (code formatter)
  \end{itemize}
  For C\# this will include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item SonarLint
    \item StyleCop
    \item UTF (Unit Test Framework)
    \item UTR (Test framework for Unity)
  \end{itemize}

  As well beyond testing tools and knowledge the team will also have to get familiar with how to validate the simulation output against the physical car data. 
  This involves working with the McMaster Baja teams data acquisition system to gather the data from the car and then how to compare that data to the simulation output.
  This will involve understanding different types of data involved with the CVT that were outlined in section 4 and learning what a correct graph of those kinds of data look like.
  
  Team skill breakdown
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Travis: Need to familiarize himself with the C\# testing tools and how to use them. As well he will need to learn how to validate the simulation output against the physical car data.
    \item Grace: Need to familiarize herself with the C\# testing tools and how to use them. As well she will need to learn how to validate the simulation output against the physical car data.
    \item Kai: Need to familiarize himself with the Python testing tools and how to use them. He is already familiar with the data acquisition system and how to gather data from the car.
    \item Cam: Need to familiarize himself with the Python testing tools and how to use them. He is already familiar with the data acquisition system and how to gather data from the car.
  \end{itemize}
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  One way to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to successfully complete the verification and validation of our project is to take watch some videos online about how to use them.
  There are many videos that are available that can teach you how to use the various testing tools that we will need to use.
  Another way to acquire the knowledge is to read the documentation for the tools libraries that we are going to use.
  This would involve reading the documentation for the testing tools that we will be using and learning how to use them from there.
  After reading some documentation you can then try to implement the tools in a small project to get a feel for how they work.

  Each team member will be using the second approach to acquire these knowledge and skills. 
  We felt that the best way to learn testing tools is to read the documentation on how they should be used.
  Then once we are implementing the POC we can use that smaller project to get a feel for how the tools work and how to use them.
  This will gives us the base knowledge and the practicality of how to use the tools in a real project.
