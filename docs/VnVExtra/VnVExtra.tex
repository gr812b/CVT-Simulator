\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\noindent This document will go into detail on the real-world data validation performed for the \progname{}. As per Dr. Smith's instructions, it will be completed prior to the course's end. This document currently serves as a placeholder for the final VnV extra report.

\section{Functional Tests Evaluation}

\subsection{Simulation Model}

\subsubsection{Position}

- Car go fast... still! Explained by poor modelling of air resistance and other resistive forces such as rolling resistance, frictions, etc
- At the end you can see error decreases a bit. Perhaps the final force of air resistance was estimated too high, but the other forces were estimated too low, giving a slightly different final value, so final speed was too high.
- Also note the poor tests mentioned later about no max velocity

\subsubsection{Velocity}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

- Car go fast, shocker! Ignored many resistive forces, no slipping so early on its most noticeable.

\subsubsection{Acceleration}

Not availabel (no data gotten from IMU)

\subsubsection{Shift}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

- We see generally a flat shift in both, which is great!
- Both also have a low ratio, although slight differences, they definitely both exist well

- Low ratio is somewhat different in calculations (causes: Wrong geometry, precision in machined parts, assumption of slip)
- Through the shift, we see some curve. A subtle change in ramps could cause this, or a poor understanding of the springs in our system. Potential in the real CVT system for spring to bind as it compresses, bringing unknown forces
- Don't see max shift much, this is due to poor data collection tests - Limits on the length of track we have access to mean we dont see our top end of the speeds our vehicle can acheive.
