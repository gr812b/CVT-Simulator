\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Grace McKenna & 11 & 0 \\
Travis Wing & 8 & 0 \\
Cameron Dunn & 5 & 2 \\
Kai Arseneau & 12 & 4 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The issue tracker is a bit skewed because of how our team manages issues, during group meetings some team members create issues that are to be worked on by multiple teammates.
This lead to not all issues being assigned to a specific team member and not all team members having an equal number of authored issues.
