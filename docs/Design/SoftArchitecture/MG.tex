\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the laid out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware on which the software is running.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format and structure of the initial input data.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acEngineSimulator}:] The engine simulator implementation could be updated or replaced as new models or technologies become available.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acExternalForces}:] External forces considered in the simulation could vary, depending on changes in design parameters or environmental considerations.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCVTSimulator}:] The CVT simulator implementation is likely change during the validation and verification (VnV) process.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acVisualizations}:] The visualizations used, and their implementation could be updated to improve the user experience or to accommodate new features.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acConstants}:] Constants used in the software could be updated based on changes to the car's physical design.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInputParameters}:] Input parameters for the system could change to include more parameters based on new requirements or to improve the accuracy of the simulation.
  \end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucConstraints}:] Constraint parameters in our model/system will remain fixed and will not change.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucExcelRun}:] The simulation will always be an acceleration run, i.e. the car will always start from rest and accelerate.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.


\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses' hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}
There are two main communication protocols used in the system.
One is for going from Unity to Python and the other is for going from Python to Unity.
Outside these two instances, the other modules' communication is handled through standard Unity or Python internal communication.

\subsection{Unity to Python}
The Unity from Python communication is handled through passing parameters.
Unity opens a terminal which calls the main Python script.
This call also includes all the parameters that are specified by the user.
These parameters are then received by the Python script and are used to run the simulation.

\subsection{Python to Unity}
The Python to Unity communication is handled through a CSV file.
After the simulation is run, the Python script writes the results to a CSV file.
Unity then reads from this CSV file and gets the results of the simulation.
This data is used to display the results of the simulation to the user.

\section{Timeline}

The following is a breakdown of the module implementation timeline, where dates and respective priorities of modules can be seen.
Modules listed in earlier phases and have earlier deadlines and thus are considered higher priority. 

\subsection*{Phase 1: Backend and Mathematical Model (January 17 - January 27, 2025)}
The backend and mathematical model are primarily the responsibility of Kai, with support from Cameron. 
This includes:Finalizing the CVT mathematical modules, which are critical to the product. Additionally, the engine and external forces modules, which are already mostly complete, will be integrated into the system.
Initial validation and verification will also be conducted. These checks will include ensuring that values increase monotonically where expected, verifying the realism of generated values within the context of the problem, and performing quick automated tests that do not rely on realistic data. 
These steps will help ensure the robustness of the backend before integration. This will take up the remaining time.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item This will involve graphical representation to ensure our outputs match expected/predicted outputs.
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Phase 2: Frontend and Communication with backend (January 22 - February 11th, 2025)}
Note that February 11th is the date Rev 0 is due, Additionally, these dates also overlap with some Phase 1 dates as various group members were able to work on the stages simultaneously. 
The Unity and user interface components will be developed collaboratively by Travis and Grace. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{January 22 - February 1 : UI Prototype Development}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement \textbf{Initialize Module (M\ref{mInitialize})}
        \item Implement \textbf{Hardware-Hiding Module (M\ref{mHH})}
        \item Implement \textbf{GUI Module (M\ref{mGUI})}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{February 1 - February 10 : Developing Playback Functionality, Outputs and Further UI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement \textbf{Playback (M\ref{mPlayback})}
        \item Implement \textbf{Visualizer (M\ref{mVisualizer})}
        \item Implement \textbf{File Output Module (M\ref{mFileOutput})}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{February 3 - February 10 : Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Team-wide testing of integration of UI and frontend to back end integration.
      \item Ensure each component functions as intended.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

This prototype will handle user input effectively and include visualizations such as 3D models, graphs, gauges, and other essential elements. 
These features are intended to provide an intuitive and visually engaging user experience. 
Initial testing of these will be done via early user feedback, ensuring simple bugs are caught and feedback can be acquired for later use. 

\subsection*{Additional Notes}
All updates and task tracking will be managed through the project GitHub repository. The repository can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/gr812b/CVT-Simulator/issues}. 
Between the dates of January 15th and February 10th, 2025, effective communication between subteams will be vital to ensure the integration process proceeds smoothly heading into Rev 0. 
Team members are encouraged to check in regularly to verify that progress aligns with the established timeline.
