\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of conducting a hazard analysis when designing software that aims to improve the
McMaster Baja team's Continuous Variable Transmission(CVT), is to identify and become aware of potential risks that could negatively affect the project. 
A hazard such as producing flawed simulations could delay the tuning process and create unreliable and incorrect outputs thus negatively impacting the vehicle performance and efficiency. 
These performance flaws could then lead to losses during Baja competitions. 
Through exploring the possible hazards involved, the project's code quality can be enhanced, potential risks can be mitigated and it ensures that the system will function as intended. 
\\\\
\noindent This document assumes that the user has access to a hard drive with sufficient storage space to download the software, an appropriate computer that meets the system requirements and a stable internet connection when downloading the software. 
\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [A1:] Users will not intentionally misuse the software or purposefully try to find unsafe settings.
    \item [A2:] The system that the software is running on will be not compromised and will function in a standard manner.
    \item [A3:] Third party software and libraries used are trusted to be safe and free of vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}


\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
