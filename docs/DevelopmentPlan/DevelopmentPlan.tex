\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet in person between 2:30-4:30pm on a weekly basis. 
Additionally, the team will plan to meet virtually or in person as the team sees fit on Fridays at 1:30-2:30pm.
Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed, based on the current status of the team's progress towards upcoming course deadlines. 
All meetings held will have a corresponding GitHub issue templates that are to be filled out by the meeting chair in order to document the meeting and hold the meeting agenda. 
The role of the meeting chair will rotate depending on the content being covered during the meeting. 
The default role of meeting chair will be designated to Cameron Dunn. 

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The team will use a structured Discord server with specific channels to organize conversations and content. 
The team will have a channel for scheduling, resources, meetings and general questions and communication. 
Additionally, the team will communicate through the use of GitHub issues and commits. 
The team will use tags to improve the communication of GitHub issues, for example backend and frontend tags. 

\section{Team Member Roles}

\subsection*{Grace McKenna}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Notetaker
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Travis Wing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item GitHub issue manager
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cameron Dunn}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting chair
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Kai Arseneau}
\begin{itemize}
	\item GitHub Reviewer
\end{itemize}

Although some roles are listed above, the team will plan to rotate larger roles throughout the project to ensure all team members have an equal role in the project.
Additionally, this will ensure all team members have knowledge about all parts of the project. 


\section{Workflow Plan}
Main branch - releases + mandatory 3 code reviews (everybody)
Develop branch - development + mandatory 1 review
Feature branches - individual features being added to develop

CI or linting and automatic testing once implemented
CD doesnt really make sense since we are making a local application and doesn't really apply to our stakeholders

Make our own code template for bug report, new features, etc. Same for PRs 
Ticket types: Bug, New feature, Refactor, Documentation, Testing
Backend, frontend, testing

In cases where teammates collaborate on an issue or document, the team will use co-authored commits in GitHub

integration tests on full features, then run on each PR for regression testing

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}



\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The main risks include not being able to validate our simulation, not being able to successfully reflect real world factors such as friction and having limitation due to the level of the mathematics our team is able to simulate. During our proof of concept demonstration our team will demonstrate the mathematics and compare our calculations to existing data that exists and is available to our team through McMaster's Baja Racing team. Our proof of concept will aim to simulate the math behind our team's project. 


What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{ What external
libraries?  }

\begin{itemize}
\item Python
\item C\#
\item Framework: Unity
\item Unity test framework
\item Math
\item Version Control: git
\item GitHub
\item GitHub Projects
\item 3D model - CAD
\item Microsoft Excel
\item VS Code
\item The Data Viewer - pre-existing website to graph and view data, designed by McMaster's Baja Racing Team.
\item Linter tool: Flake8
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\end{itemize}

\section{Coding Standard}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality of the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

All team members are to communicate regarding their attendance of team meetings.
If a team member is unable to attend a meeting, the meeting will either be rescheduled, depending on the importance of the content being covered in the meeting, or the team member will be debriefed by another team member. 
Team members are expected to communicate with one another if they will be late or need to leave the team meeting early. 



\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

Team members will always treat one another with respect and have a positive attitude towards one another. 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

\wss{How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)? }

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

\wss{How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus?  Vote? How will you
handle disagreements? }
